Course 4: Operating Systems and Security Infrastructure
This project demonstrates core skills in systems administration and infrastructure security by applying best practices to manage file and directory permissions in Linuxâ€”an essential, hands-on skill for any Security Analyst who works with server and research environments.

Deliverable
Linux File Permissions Report
This document details the precise Linux commands used to manage file and directory authorizations in a research environment scenario. It showcases the ability to apply the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) and provides a full explanation of permission structures, octal notation, and command output.

Key Skills Demonstrated
Access Control: Using the chmod command for file and directory permission management.

Principle of Least Privilege: Strictly limiting user and group access (e.g., read-only) to sensitive files.

Command Line Proficiency: Interpreting command output like the 10-character permission string from ls -la.

System Hardening: Securing hidden files and using the recursive flag (-R) for comprehensive directory protection.
