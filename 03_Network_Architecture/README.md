Course 3: Network Architecture and Security
This project demonstrates proficiency in security architecture design and incident analysis following a critical Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) event. The deliverables show the ability to translate real-world security failures into proactive architectural improvements, applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) for both design and response.

Deliverables
1. Security Architecture Design Report
This report outlines the proposed secure network architecture, moving from a vulnerable flat topology to a resilient, segmented, Zero Trust model. It details the placement and justification for security controls, including NGFW, DMZ, VLANs, SIEM, and ZTNA.

2. Incident Report Analysis (NIST CSF)
An analysis of the DDoS incident, detailing the attack, cause, and impact. It uses the NIST CSF (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) to structure a comprehensive action plan for preventing recurrence.

Key Skills Demonstrated
Security Architecture Design: Creating resilient, multi-layered defense models (Defense-in-Depth).

Network Segmentation: Implementing VLANs and a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).

Zero Trust Principles: Incorporating MFA and identity verification into access controls.

Incident Response: Applying the NIST CSF (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) to structure crisis management.

Log Management (SIEM): Planning for centralized security monitoring and alerting.
